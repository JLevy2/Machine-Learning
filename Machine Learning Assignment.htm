cleaned by 1) removing all variables that had NA’s present. Each of these
variables were missing 97% of the observations, 2) removing all variables that
did not contain variation, and 3) removing the first 6 variables because their
descriptive names indicated that they would not have predictive power. This reduced
the training dataset from containing 159 predictor variables to 5e predictor
variables. The variables that were removed from the training dataset were also
removed from the testing dataset.</span></span></p>

These models included all variables using the machine learning methods of random
forests and partitioning with trees. The gradient boosting algorithm was also
going to be considered but it repeatedly crashed my computer so it was omitted
from the analysis. Additionally, PCA was going to be considered as a
preprocessing method but the accuracy of the random forest algorithm with all the
predictors was excellent so PCA was not performed. Model stacking was also
going to be performed but since the accuracy of the random forest algorithm was
so high, stacking was unnecessary.</span></span></p>

the prediction accuracy of the selected model on the validation data set.
Because this is based on the validation dataset, it is likely higher than the
actual out of sample error. When the data were split, I thought that the
testing dataset would have the correct classe answers so I initially planned to
use the testing dataset to determine the out of sample error. However, this
dataset did not contain the classes variable so it could not be used for the
purposes of an error estimate.  </span></span></p>
